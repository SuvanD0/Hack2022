# Hack2022

Hi our team consists of four students at The Ohio State University studying computer science and engineering. 
We created this project for the 2022 OHIO Hackathon where we aimed to solve AEP's Wind data challenge. We created
a interactive web application that displays AEP's Oklahoma turbine data and also shows our machine learning
algorithm to rate the efficiency and quality of wind turbines using training from the original dataset. In addition, 
we integrated open source weather api to display hypothetical turbines in different terrains and weathers and used our
machine learning algorithm to deliver an output of whether a turbine there would be efficient and feasible. Thank you 
for viewing our project!
